    <p>This is Brazilian favorite (and an old family recipe), and takes no cooking at all. It's a little tart and tangy for those of you who don't like your desserts to be too sweet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>
        <ul>8 passion fruits</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon white sugar</ul>
        <ul>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</ul>
        <ul>2 cups cream</ul>
    </li>

    <h2>Alright! Got the ingredients... But what should I do now?</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>Break passion fruits in half, and empty contents into a bowl. Use a little water to help rinse the juice out of the skins. Mix with hands to soften pulp. Strain through a sieve or cheesecloth. Stir in sugar and sweetened condensed milk.</ol>
        <ol>In a chilled bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the passion fruit mixture, then quickly fold in remaining cream until no streaks remain. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</ol>
    </li>
