    <p>This feijoada recipe is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean stew that maintains the rich smoky, flavors famous in Brazil.
    Additional meats, including sausage, may be added if desired. This is excellent served over brown rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>
            <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil</ul>
            <ul>1 ½ cups chopped onion, divided</ul>
            <ul>½ cup green onions, chopped</ul>
            <ul>1 clove garlic, chopped</ul>
            <ul>1 (12 ounce) package dry black beans, soaked overnight</ul>
            <ul>2 smoked ham hocks</ul>
            <ul>8 ounces diced ham</ul>
            <ul>½ pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</ul>
            <ul>2 bay leaves, crushed</ul>
            <ul>⅛ teaspoon ground coriander</ul>
            <ul>salt and pepper to taste</ul>
            <ul>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</ul>
            <ul>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</ul>
        </li>

        <h2>Alright, got the ingredientes. What now?</h2>
        <li>
            <ol>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes. Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.</ol>
            <ol>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion. Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to beans.</ol>
            <ol>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</ol>
            <ol>Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes.</ol>
            <ol>Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more.</ol>
            <ol>Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.</ol>
